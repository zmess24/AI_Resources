Second, Greek yogurt is loaded with healthy bacteria known as probiotics, which perform a host of positive functions for your intestinal health and aid in digestion.

Just use 1/4 extra cup of liquid egg whites (or two whole eggs).\nConsider adding some seeds to the mix! Flaxseeds or poppy seeds are a delicious addition."

Second, Greek yogurt is loaded with healthy bacteria known as probiotics, which perform a host of positive functions for your intestinal health and aid in digestion. If those reasons aren't enough, Greek yogurt also is a great substitute for sweet cravings at night.
